### Past

I started college right around the time the Internet "came online". It was a very exciting time for me, reading Neuromancer and feeling like I was exploring cyberspace. As a CompSci student, I was concerned that I might not be learning the right language. Sure we were doing C++, but that had just replaced C. What if another language were to come along?

Since that time, I've learned many languages and I've come to feel I could take any language and figure it out. The language wasn't the concern, just remembering all the correct syntax. And if that was ever a problem, just pop on the Net to see some examples.

### Present

But what about the discipline of coding? There are three qualities I feel a good software engineer should have. First: are you able to hear a large problem and break it down into smaller, easier to handle problems? Many times my mind has been overwhelmed with the task at hand. If I just slow down and think about it in smaller chunks, then it can be managed.

Another is, do you have a good workflow? Do you have quick "turnaround time"? Can you come up with a solution, code it, test it, see the results, and come up with another answer if the last twenty didn't work? Always work to prototype, to simulate. That way you can figure out if the path you're going down maybe isn't worth it. It also helps in stopping people making solutions that are overly complicated.

And the third quality: Keep It Simple, Stupid. They actually told us about KISS in college and I've always appreciated it when I come across it. Or rather, usually I've felt the pain when it's not there.

### Future

Right now, I'm starting to feel like I'm on the edge of a cliff. I see the AI revolution approaching and I am uneasy because I don't know how to process it. Deep down inside there's also excitement in me. If we could just explain our ideas to a machine and have it do the implementation, imagine how much bigger problems we could solve? Do we need KISS, or leave that part up to the AI?

It almost feels like we get to lead an orchestra and the flute player is really good, and the trumpet guy can really hit those notes. We just need to direct them to make a song that brings the crowd to some emotion. And does my AI flute and trumpet understand that emotion? Only if I tell it what to think. :D
