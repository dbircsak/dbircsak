# Video Processing Batch Scripts

*This README was generated by Amp AI assistant*

A collection of Windows batch scripts for analyzing, listing, and combining video files using FFmpeg.

## Scripts

### FFprobeSummary.bat
Analyzes all video files in the current directory and displays their technical specifications:
- Video codec, resolution, and frame rate
- Audio codec, channels, and sample rate
- Supports: MP4, MOV, MKV, M4V formats

**Usage:** Run the script in a directory containing video files

### ListVideos.bat
Creates a text file (`video_list.txt`) containing all video filenames in the current directory.
- Supports: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, M4V, WMV, FLV formats
- Useful for preparing input lists for batch processing

**Usage:** Run the script to generate `video_list.txt`

### NormalizeAndCombine_FromList.bat
Normalizes and concatenates videos listed in `video_list.txt` into a single output file:
- **Normalization:** Converts all videos to consistent specs (1920x1080@30fps, H.264/AAC)
- **Audio handling:** Adds silent audio track if video has no audio
- **Output:** Creates `final_youtube.mp4` optimized for YouTube upload
- **Settings:** CRF 20, medium preset, 192k audio bitrate

**Prerequisites:** Requires `video_list.txt` (created by ListVideos.bat)

## Requirements
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) must be installed and available in PATH
- Windows command prompt or PowerShell

## Workflow
1. Place video files in a directory
2. Run `FFprobeSummary.bat` to analyze video specifications (optional)
3. Run `ListVideos.bat` to create the file list
4. Edit `video_list.txt` to reorder or remove videos as needed
5. Run `NormalizeAndCombine_FromList.bat` to create the final combined video
